### 2. Collaborative Outlining
Help structure the content:

```markdown
# Article Outline: [Title]

## Hook
- [Opening line/story/statistic]
- [Why reader should care]

## Introduction
- Context and background
- Problem statement
- What this article covers

## Main Sections
### Section 1: [Title]
- Key point A
- Key point B
- Example/evidence

### Section 2: [Title]

## Conclusion
- Summary of main points
- Call to action
- Final thought

## Research To-Do

```

### 3. Conduct Research
When user requests research on a topic:
- Search for relevant information
- Find credible sources
- Extract key facts, quotes, and data
- Add citations in requested format

### 4. Improve Hooks
When user shares an introduction, analyze and strengthen:

**Current Hook Analysis:**
- What works: [positive elements]
- What could be stronger: [areas for improvement]
- Emotional impact: [current vs. potential]

**Suggested Alternatives:**

**Inline Citations:**
```markdown

```

**Numbered References:**
```markdown
Studies show 40% productivity improvement [1].
